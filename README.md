# Brick Breaker Game

## Overview
Brick Breaker is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The game features four levels, each increasing in complexity as the player progresses.

This game is developed in C using the `conio` and `dos` libraries to handle graphics and game mechanics.

## Features
- **Four Levels**: The difficulty increases with each level.
- **Graphics Enhancement**: Optimized using built-in C libraries.
- **Classic Gameplay**: Bounce the ball off the paddle to break bricks.
- **Progressive Challenge**: More bricks and increased speed at higher levels.

## Installation & Execution
1. **Compile the Game**: Use a C compiler that supports `conio.h` and `dos.h`, such as Turbo C++.
2. **Run the Executable**: After compilation, execute the game in a DOS-compatible environment or an emulator like DOSBox.

## Controls
- **Left Arrow (`←`)**: Move paddle left
- **Right Arrow (`→`)**: Move paddle right

- **Escape (`ESC`)**: Exit the game

## Requirements
- Turbo C++ (or a compatible compiler)
